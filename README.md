# Overview
Leveraging the [Yelp Fusion API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-intro), build an app that displays businesses based on the user’s input in the search field. Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication) to obtain an API Key for the Yelp Fusion API (don’t be worried about hard-coding the key into your app for this assignment). You may use the [designs here](https://www.figma.com/file/vcfmVmKtPf4hPwIm12jfQ5/Android-Homework?type=design&node-id=2-9&mode=design&t=EXoeVDU6A6rwhxmO-0) as a guideline for your interface. For your UI, please utilize [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) if possible, and avoid using any 3rd party UI frameworks. If you aren’t familiar with Compose, feel free to write in Android XML instead. Do not feel obligated to utilize all the properties and stubs in the project template.
